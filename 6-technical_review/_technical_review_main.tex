This chapter will give a brief introduction to central concepts of the software frameworks outlined in the previous design chapter.
The sections covering the Unity game engine and the Leap Motion Controller are both based on their documentation pages, found at 
https://docs.unity3d.com and https://developer.leapmotion.com.
Note that although these introductions are brief, more detailed information is mentioned as necessary in the implementation chapter.

\section{Unity - The Cross-platform Game Engine}
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, and is a popular engine both in a personal- and enterprise settings.
Unity Personal is a free version for individuals and enterprises making less than 100 000\$ a year off content created in Unity, and is the 
edition used in for the implementation phase.
Unity Personal is full-featured and comes with all the necessary subsystems typically required in a game engine, like rendering, physics and scripting.
Unity makes use of either C\# or UnityScript (a dialect of JavaScript) as scripting language, where the former is the preferred by the community and 
exclusively used in the implementation. As its primary software framework Unity used \textit{Mono}, an open source development platform based on the .NET
framework. The main different between the .NET framework and the Mono framework is that mono aims to be platform independent, whereas .NET is Windows only.
The major components of the Mono framework is a C\# compiler, a runtime environment, the .NET class library and a Mono class library.

In Unity, all script which will be using the framework must be derived from the base class \texttt{MonoBehavior}. 
This class contains a lot of key functions in the Unity framework, such as \texttt{Start()} and \texttt{Update()}. 
The following are important concept in Unity:
