\section{The gestures}
As mention in the user stories for the application, all of the application's functionality should be accessible by using gestures. The user should thus
be able to do every task only by using gestures (except the "look around story"). To support this a gesture scheme of six individual 
gestures were created. These are functionality described below and will be covered in more technical detail during the next chapter.
 
\subsection{The pinch gesture}
\subsection{The palm-down gesture}
\subsection{The palm-side gesture}
\subsection{The fist gesture}
\subsection{The point gesture}
\subsection{The double-point gesture}
