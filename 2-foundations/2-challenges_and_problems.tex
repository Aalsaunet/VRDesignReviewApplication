Problems with using VR + e.g Leap over mouse + keyboard + display. E.g:

\subsection{The "writing issue"}

Regular keyboards are impractical. 
See "ideer til masteroppgaven.txt"

\subsection{Challenges in "designing" gesture schemes}
People have different preferences. Have intuitive gestures. Have gestures that is not too
fatiguing. Have gesture with high precision and recall (F-score) (high TP and TN. Low FP, FN).
Have a system that doesnt mistake one gesture for another.

\subsubsection{Fixes?}
User-gesture calibration. 

\subsection{The VR sickness issue}
