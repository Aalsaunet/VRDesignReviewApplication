@article{PerezFernandez2015,
abstract = {A natural consequence of the extended use of CAD systems for the design and production of any kind of vessel is its use in Virtual Reality environments, mainly because now it has become an accessible technology. Virtual Reality is extended in every industry, in every sector, at any level. Important improvements both in software and hardware have had an important impact in its use in the shipbuilding industry, where it is necessary to handle complex ship 3D models with huge amount of data. So, efficiency is the base condition in the Virtual Reality navigation around a vessel. To enhance it, there are three important factors that play a fundamental role. The first one is having an appropriate CAD system with all the information of the ship in a single data base. The second important issue is to have a viewer, which is a tool that allows the management of the 3D model to be used in Virtual Reality environments. No need to say that a good integration between the viewer and the CAD system will be translated into more functionality and better performance. Finally, the third important player is hardware, which makes possibility the Virtual Reality navigation in many different environments. This paper describes first of all different efficient uses of Virtual Reality in the shipbuilding industry, taking in consideration all the agents involved and describing in particular the advantages for any of them. Regarding the software requirements, it will be described in particular the new FVIEWER, developed by SENER for the Virtual Reality navigation and design review and based on the FORAN system. From the hardware side, it will be described some of the most relevant and feasible applications of the Virtual Reality, taking in consideration potential uses and accessible technology in the market. The future of the Virtual Reality in shipbuilding will be explained after that.},

Results showed that this method identified individuals who were unable to complete a driving simulator study due to simulator sickness with greater than 90% accuracy and that older participants had a greater likelihood of simulator sickness than younger participants. Possible explanations for increased symptoms experienced by older participants are discussed as well as implications for research ethics and simulator sickness prevention. "

@article{Draper2001,
abstract = {Novel patterns of visual-vestibular intersensory stimulation often result in symptoms of simulator sickness, raising health and safety concerns regarding virtual environment exposure. Two experiments investigated the effect of conflicting visual-vestibular cues on subjective reports of simulator sickness during and after a 50-min exposure to a head-coupled virtual interface. Virtual image scale factors (0.5. 1.0, 2.0 magnification, generated by varying geometric field of view angle) were investigated in Experiment 1, and additional system time delays (125, 250 ms) were investigated in Experiment 2. Simulator sickness metrics included spoken self-reports during exposure and simulator sickness questionnaires (pre-exposure, immediate postexposure, and 20 min postexposure). Head yaw angular position data were also recorded. Reports of simulator sickness symptoms were significantly greater in the minification (0.5) and magnification (2.0) image scale factor conditions than in the neutral condition (1.0). Simulator sickness did not vary with changes in time delay, however. Furthermore, a comparison across experiments suggests no appreciable increase in simulator sickness with increasing time delays above the nominal value (48 ms). Head angular position data exhibited certain systematic variations across conditions. Actual or potential applications of this research include virtual environment training, simulation, and entertainment systems.},

@article{Lin2004,
abstract = {This study developed a new procedure, a Virtual Guiding Avatar (VGA), which combined self-motion prediction cues and an independent visual background (IVB) to alleviate simulator sickness (SS). The VGA, which was embodied as an abstract airplane, was designed to lead the participant along a horizontal motion trajectory through a virtual environment. Both motion prediction cues and IVBs, which provide an earth-fixed reference frame, reduced SS in separate previous studies. Participants were exposed to complex visual motion through a cartoon-like simulated environment in a very wide field of view driving simulator. Participants' responses to avatars with varying motion properties - fixed, rotation only or rotation plus translation - were assessed using a within-subjects experimental design. Results indicated that SS was reduced by a VGA that presented rotational cues alone or rotation plus translation. The VGA also increased participants' sense of presence and enjoyment relative to conditions lacking a VGA. The VGA procedure can be used to enhance user experiences in immersive virtual environments as well as to improve motion simulator design.},

@article{Barrett2004,
abstract = {Cybersickness symptoms are the unintended psychophysiological side effects of participation in virtual environments. Symptoms can occur both during and after participation, thus having implications for health and safety, user acceptance, and overall system effectiveness. Just as for other visually induced motion sickness, cybersickness is believed to result from sensory and perceptual mismatches between the visual and vestibular systems, and can be considered as a problem of adaptation to altered environments. Symptoms can be grouped into three dimensions: nausea, disorientation or postural instability, and visual symptoms. Numerous factors relating to the individual participants, the virtual reality system and virtual environment used, and the task carried out, can affect either incidence or severity of cybersickness. Taking account of these factors may avoid or minimise symptoms. This report reviews the literature on cybersickness, simulation sickness, and the relevant research on motion sickness, considers measures that have been proposed to manage and treat cybersickness, and identifies areas where more research is needed.},

The present paper reviews: the signs and symptoms, stimuli and response characteristics, anatomical structures, and susceptibility factors. The prevalent theories of the genesis of this malady are put forth and an integrating theory is propose which suggests that simulator sickness is a form of motion sickness and may be best understood as a special case of sensory rearrangement. Other works in this series (1) descrive the scope of the problem, (2) report the incidence in over 4500 exposures, and (3) list more than 2000 relavant references. The theory which is offered suggest that motion sickness is a result of decorrelation between and within sensory input channels of information. This correlation theory which is offered suggests that motion sickness is a result of decorrelation between and within sensory input channels of information. This correlation theory is in general agreement with the perceptual conflict or cue mismatch theories, and implies that the central nervous system (CNS) perceives decorrelated stimulations as toxic events. This CNS interpretation of toxicity causes the constellation of symptoms associated with motion sickness to be released.

abstract = {Human computer interaction (HCI) plays a vital role in bridging the 'Digital Divide', bringing people closer to consumer electronics control in the 'lounge'. Keyboards and mouse or remotes do alienate old and new generations alike from control interfaces. Hand Gesture Recognition systems bring hope of connecting people with machines in a natural way. This will lead to consumers being able to use their hands naturally to communicate with any electronic equipment in their 'lounge.' This monograph will include the state of the art hand gesture recognition approaches and how they evolved from their inception. The author would also detail his research in this area for the past 8 years and how the future might turn out to be using HCI. This monograph will serve as a valuable guide for researchers (who would endeavour into) in the world of HCI.},

abstract = {Successful efforts in hand gesture recognition research within the last two decades paved the path for natural human-computer interaction systems. Unresolved challenges such as reliable identification of gesturing phase, sensitivity to size, shape, and speed variations, and issues due to occlusion keep hand gesture recognition research still very active. We provide a review of vision-based hand gesture recognition algorithms reported in the last 16 years. The methods using RGB and RGB-D cameras are reviewed with quantitative and qualitative comparisons of algorithms. Quantitative comparison of algorithms is done using a set of 13 measures chosen from different attributes of the algorithm and the experimental methodology adopted in algorithm evaluation. We point out the need for considering these measures together with the recognition accuracy of the algorithm to predict its success in real-world applications. The paper also reviews 26 publicly available hand gesture databases and provides the web-links for their download.},

Now, gesture recognition is becoming a commonplace technology, enabling humans and machines to interface more easily in the home, the automobile and at work. Imagine a person sitting on a couch, controlling the lights and TV with a wave of his hand. This and other capabilities are being realized as gesture recognition technologies enable natural interactions with the electronics that surround us. Gesture recognition has long been researched with 2D vision, but with the advent of 3D sensor technology, its applications are now more diverse, spanning a variety of markets.},

@article{Guna2014,
	abstract = {We present the results of an evaluation of the performance of the Leap Motion Controller with the aid of a professional, high-precision, fast motion tracking system. A set of static and dynamic measurements was performed with different numbers of tracking objects and configurations. For the static measurements, a plastic arm model simulating a human arm was used. A set of 37 reference locations was selected to cover the controller's sensory space. For the dynamic measurements, a special V-shaped tool, consisting of two tracking objects maintaining a constant distance between them, was created to simulate two human fingers. In the static scenario, the standard deviation was less than 0.5 mm. The linear correlation revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation when moving away from the controller. The results of the dynamic scenario revealed the inconsistent performance of the controller, with a significant drop in accuracy for samples taken more than 250 mm above the controller's surface. The Leap Motion Controller undoubtedly represents a revolutionary input device for gesture-based human-computer interaction; however, due to its rather limited sensory space and inconsistent sampling frequency, in its current configuration it cannot currently be used as a professional tracking system.},

However, up to this point its capabilities in real environments have not been analyzed. Therefore, this paper presents a first study of a Leap Motion Controller. The main focus of attention is on the evaluation of the accuracy and repeatability. For an appropriate evaluation, a novel experimental setup was developed making use of an industrial robot with a reference pen allowing a position accuracy of 0.2 mm. Thereby, a deviation between a desired 3D position and the average measured positions below 0.2 mm has been obtained for static setups and of 1.2 mm for dynamic setups. Using the conclusion of this analysis can improve the development of applications for the Leap Motion controller in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.},
