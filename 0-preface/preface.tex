\chapter*{Abstract}                    
Traditionally the idea of several people interacting in a virtual world, and the emerging virtual reality technologies (e.g Oculus Rift and HTC Vive etc) have been 
closely tied to the gaming- and entertainment industry. 
As of this date, these technological advances remains mostly irrelevant for most other industry segments, but could this be about to change? 
This essay will explore the possibilities of applying these technologies to the design and engineering segment of the industry.
