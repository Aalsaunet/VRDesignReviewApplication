\chapter{Evaluation of the implementation}

To evaluate the application's ability to meet user requirements, two rounds of user testing seasons were conducted at the DNV GL headquarters in HÃ¸vik, Norway.
The first of these season were held the 24th March 2017 and involved one test person, while the second round were held at X and involved Y persons. 
The users were brought in individually and asked to take a seated position at an ordinary work stations with a mouse, keyboard and display, 
in addition to a leap motion controller positioned at the desk between the keyboard and the user. A HTC Vive head mount was also present for use during the experimentation phase. 

The computer used for the testing had the following specifications (hardware and software):
\begin{itemize}
    \item An Intel i7 as processor.
    \item 8 GB of RAM.
    \item A Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 graphics card.
    \item A Windows 10 64-bit operating system (build 14393).
    \item Unity 5.5.2
    \item Leap Motion Control Panel version 3.2.0+45899
    \item Steam VR runtime (for use with the HTC Vive head mount)
\end{itemize}

After the user was seated the test phases were conducted in the following order (including an estimated of alloted time):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  5 minutes of introduction. The users were informed about the purpose of the application, some of its long term goals and its limitations.
    \item 10 minutes of demonstration. The users were shown each of the possible actions and the different gestures available to them.
    \item 15 minutes of instructions. The users followed a series of instructions and oral explanations to teach them to use the program.
    \item 20 minutes of experimentation. The users were asked to use the program freely without any instructions.  
    \item 10 minutes of questions. The users were interviewed with a series of questions related to the application and their experience using it.   
\end{enumerate}

With the exception of the experimentation phase, all the steps above were conducted without the use of a VR head mount. In the experimentation phase
the users were asked to divide their time equally between using the application in "desktop mode" (i.e using an regular display without a VR head mount) and
"VR mode" (i.e using a VR head mount). 

\section{The instructions}
The users were asked to perform the following tasks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform a pinch gesture by pushing the thumb and index finger together, while keeping the palm directed against the table surface. 
          Move the hand which holding the pinch gesture to rotate the camera along the X and Y axis.
\end{enumerate}
