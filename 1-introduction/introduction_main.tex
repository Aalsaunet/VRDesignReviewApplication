\section{Background}           
The field of virtual reality technology has seen an exciting development in recent years, 
with the release of the first commercially successful virtual reality headsets, such as the Oculus Rift CV1 and HTC Vive, taking place in 2016.
The application area for these virtual reality headset have exceeded the expectations of many, with virtual reality 
technology already being present in several different domains, ranging from engineering to entertainment~\citep{VRS2016}. 
\citet{VRS2016}, among others, reports numerous domains where virtual reality is successful being used, including 
healthcare (e.g in surgery), military, architecture/construction, art, fashion, entertainment (games, films etc), education, business, telecommunications, sports and rehabilitation.

With the success of virtual reality technology, and increased attention towards technologies that complement it, several businesses and institutions 
are interested in making use of the new possibilities virtual reality offer~\citep{TW22016}. One major business area for virtual reality, besides entertainment, 
has been in the architecture, engineering and construction fields. Iris VR, a New York-based technology company building virtual reality applications, has reported that
among their 15 000 customers, 75\% are from these industry segments. One possible reason for the impact virtual reality has had on these fields is their dependence 
on big and complex 3D models. As virtual reality head mounted devices (HMD) are stereoscopic, i.e provide separate images for each eye, they are able to deliver a feeling of 
depth and scale that is unrivaled by regular two dimensional displays~\citep{POLYGON2016}. This point was highlighted in an interview of a senior designer at an architect 
firm, conducted by~\citet{TW22016}. He stated that "Practically nobody can understand architectural drawings, and even 3D visualizations are a stretch for most. 
But everybody gets VR instinctively. You can get to the point very quickly. It either sells or kills the project right away." 

Virtual reality applications that allow its users to inspect models in 3D also has many additional possibilities. 
One example is to be able to work (e.g.~to edit, annotate or comment) on the model while being "inside" it (e.g.~when wearing a virtual reality HMD) and 
to use the virtual reality application as a design and collaboration tool to exchange ideas about the model.
DNV GL, the world's largest maritime classification society, is looking into exactly this, and view this as a potential big improvement over their current 
"paper-based" work flow. More specifically, DNV GL is interested in a virtual reality application for design reviews, a classification process where DNV GL employees review 
clients' design models and comments on various aspects of the models that need to be improved to meet the classification requirements. 

This thesis will address this vision and utilize several state-of-the-art frameworks and technologies to design and implement such 
an application. This presents several challenges, some of which will be mentioned in the next section and reviewed more throughout the thesis, while 
DNV GL, their work flow, visions and motivations will be discussed further in chapter~\ref{chapter:dnvgl}. 


\section{The Challenges of Virtual Reality} 
Despite the early success the field of virtual reality technology has seen, there are still a lot challenges associated with it. 
These challenges include prevention of virtual reality sickness (a kind of induced motion sickness), 
strict performance demands on target hardware and having more suitable input methods when using virtual reality HMDs. % (human-computer interactions).
Addressing these challenges, in both design and implementation, is an important step when building virtual reality software~\citep{OCULUS2016}, 
and each of these challenges, among others, will be discussed more in the following chapters.

As virtual reality technology enables users to experience virtual worlds in a new way, 
human-computer interaction (HCI) is also a highly relevant topic. 
This field has in many ways seen a resurgence as virtual technology gives new possibilities, but also set new constrains. 
One of these constraints is limiting the user's field of vision exclusively to that projected by the lenses, 
which may make interaction with traditional input devices, such as mouse and keyboard, more challenging. 
Because of this, alternate methods of interacting with the computer is a relevant topic. 
One of these methods is the use of gestures, 
which have long been considered an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, 
creative and intuitive methods for interacting with computers~\citep{Rautaray2015}. 
To enable the use of gestures as a viable input method to a computer, responsive and reliable gesture recognition techniques are needed.  

\section{Problem definition}
This thesis will review how the current state-of-the-art virtual reality- and vision-based gesture recognition technologies can be utilized in a professional capacity, and more
specificaly to the design reviews of complex 3D models. 
Instead of printing the model to paper, drawing on the paper, scanning it and sending it by email - as isn't an uncommon work flow today, 
the designer and design review could have a virtual design review meeting, were the designer and reviewer could meet on the 3D model, interact, survey- and annotate it together. 
This could be enhanced by virtual reality technology, giving a unique sense of scale and a depth - which is hard to match by regular "2D screens" - and 
gesture recognition technology, allowing the user to work with the 3D model in new and innovative ways. 

This is the vision of DNV GL, a major international classification company working with this design review process. 


This vision was pursued by implementing an application that enabled the user to navigate the model and create annotation - 
i.e comments or remarks to an aspect of the model - that were position in the model and either represented as "annotation orbs" or as an object highlighting.
The design review application is also a prototype developed for the major international classification company DNV GL to evaluate how the use of virtual reality and gesture
% recognition technology might benefit their design review process. As such, the application requirements have been created in cooperation with DNV GL and represents
% common 3D object manipulating and navigation tasks


% This thesis will evaluate the consequences of utilizing virtual reality technology in combination with vision based gesture recognition technology, and discuss the benefits it 
% might bring, as well and the challenges it presents. 
% The thesis will also review the design and implementation of a design review application, which is developed as part of this thesis with the aforementioned goal in mind.

\section{Limitations}
The initial list of application features had to be shortened significantly to focus more on the most relevant parts for this thesis. As such the design review application
is more a prototype or proof-of-concept than a finished product. Section 5.2.1 outlines the application features and will explain more of what's included in the application and what isn't.
