% This essay has given a brief summary of the virtual reality design review application that is going to be implemented for DNV GL 
% as part of the master's thesis, and how virtual reality- and gesture recognition technology can be utilized to potentially improve the 
% human-computer interaction experience beyond that of more conventional interaction methods. 
% 
% Gesture recognition technology is often divided into the categories of vision-based and contact-based, where the former usually is the 
% preferred one because of user-friendliness and the health concerns associated with the latter. Vision-based gesture recognition devices usually 
% utilize either stereoscopic vision-, structured light pattern- or time of flight techniques, where stereoscopic vision-based devices have proved the most promising. 
% One device of this kind is the Leap Motion Controller, which consists of two stereoscopic cameras and three infrared LEDs and periodically captures 
% grayscale stereo images which are sent to the tracking software, where 3D representations are constructed. 
% 
% The master's thesis aims to evaluate the performance and user experience of utilizing a Leap Motion Controller in combination with the Oculus 
% Rift and HTC Vive virtual reality headsets during a virtual design review in a complex 3D model. The final application should thus be primarily 
% focused on utilizing the most intuitive ways of interacting with complex 3D models in a collaborative virtual reality setting.     	                                     


% Through previous research endeavours vision-based gesture recognition devices has proved to be the most promising ones, 
% and it has already seen some moderate commercial success through devices such as the XBox Kinect and the Leap Motion Controller. 
% However, many previous research articles states that the techniques implemented for hand gesture recognition often are sensitive to poor resolution, 
% frame rate, drastic illumination conditions, changing weather conditions and occlusions among other prevalent problems in the hand gesture recognition 
% systems~\citep{Rautaray2015}.

% Despite these reported shortcomings, the upcoming master's thesis will explore areas where gesture recognition technology might perform in a sufficient manner, 
% and also explore how a gesture recognition system can be used in combination with more traditional input-methods, such as a mouse, keyboard, gamepad or joystick. 
% The final application implementation should thus be primarily focused on utilizing the most intuitive ways of interacting with complex 3D models in a virtual reality setting.   

% the use cases for these are still somewhat limited and has often been reported to not have a reliable enough tracking and recognition~\citep{Guna2014}.
